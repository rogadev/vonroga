## About Ryan

I'm a JavaScript developer who loves working with Node, Express, Vue, Svelte, and more. I am actively looking for a summer coop in 2022 and/or for regular part-time remote work (or local to Nanaimo, Victoria, or Courtenay, BC). If you have a position you think would be a good fit, please feel free to get in touch (contact details below).

## My Story

A few years before the global pandemic, I started a small exterior cleaning business. I built it from the ground up, heavily leveraging my skills in web development to grow it into what it is today. Somewhere along the path, I went deep down the rabbit hole of creating automated backend services to assist my workflow and enhance the customer journey.

When the pandemic hit, my business took a hit with it. Once the Canadian government rolled out CERB we were unable to keep or hire a single employee and our business ground to a halt. I made the decision to pivot, both my business and my own trajectory, and started getting deeper into web development, SaaS, and business automation. I moved up island to enhance my skills through university and developed a [window cleaning quote tool](https://nicdgl113.github.io/course-project-vonroga/) and other micro SaaS products for my business.

After my first year, I taught myself Vue, Svelte, Node/Express, MongoDB and more over the summer break. In 2022 I'll be looking for a summer coop to hone my skills. If this journey spoke to you and you think you might have a coop position or part-time position that might interest me, please feel free to get in touch.
