I'm Ryan Roga. Aspiring junior web developer, working on a diploma in Web and Mobile Application Development at VIU (Vancouver Island University). I'm starting year 2 this fall (2021). This summer I spent most of my time learning Vue, Svelte, Node, and Express. I've also been working on a few small side projects for my business.

I've built a small full stack application for Granny Go Go, a company that drives dialysis patients to/from appointments all over Vancouver Island.

Several years ago I started my own small business in Victoria, BC, Canada - [MossAway Services Inc](https://www.mossaway.ca). We currently have 2 locations here on Vancouver Island [(2nd location - Comox Window Cleaning)](https://www.comoxwindowcleaning.com). In 2019 I was awarded the BBB Torch Award and was nominated again in 2020. I've developed several small web apps that we use within the business on a regular basis including a [window pane counting tool](https://nicdgl113.github.io/course-project-vonroga/) using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. I've also integrated a great deal of automation using the API integration tool [Zapier](https://zapier.com/). 

If you're looking for a junior developer, even for a part time position, please feel free to get in touch.
