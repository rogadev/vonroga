I'm Ryan Roga. Student of Web and Mobile Application Development at North Island College. I'm also learning Vue.js and React.js on my own time, and developing several small passion projects for my own business.

I run a small exterior cleaning company in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. I also run a second smaller window cleaning company in Courtenay, British Columbia, Canada. I've already integrated a few small projects that I developed into my operational work flow.

I'll be graduating in 2022. I'll be looking for a full-time career in web development and also planto develop a few of my own small side projects. If you're looking for developer who knows business, feel free to drop me a line.
