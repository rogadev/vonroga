I'm Ryan Roga. Aspiring junior web developer, working on a diploma in Web and Mobile Application Development at VIU (Vancouver Island University). I'm starting year 2 this fall (2021). This summer I spent most of my time learning Vue, React, Node, and Express. I've also been working on a few small side projects.

Four years ago I started my own small business here on Vancouver Island. We currently have 2 locations and a small but amazing crew. In 2019 we earned the Torch Award and were nominated again for 2020. I believe my purpose in life is making things better and I am passionate about being the best at what I do.

My business (and perhaps the global pandemic) ultimately brought me back to software development. The tools I was using to drive my business were not up to speed with what I wanted to accomplish, so I went online and started building my own tools. When the pandemic hit, our business took a hit in turn. I decided that I would make use of a little extra free time and really dive all the way in and learn the skills I was eagerly picking up as I went. I enrolled to NIC full-time while also managing my business full time. I landed a 3.5GPA and upgraded to VIU for year 2. I'm looing forward to writing the rest of this story next spring.
